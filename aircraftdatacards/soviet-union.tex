\section*{Yak-9}

The Yakovlev Yak-9 was a propeller-driven fighter developed during WWII and which first entered service in 1942. After WWII, it was supplied to many Soviet client states, including the People's Republic of China and North Korea. The NATO reporting name is “Frank.”

There were several versions. The Yak-9D was a long-ranged escort fighter and was armed with one 20 mm ShVAK cannon and one 12.7 mm UBS machine gun. The Yak-9U had a more powerful engine, more use of aluminium, and added a second UBS machine gun. The Yak-9P was a development of the -9U with completely metal wings.

The Yak-9U/-9P were used by the KPAF and saw extensive service in the first weeks of the Korean War. They were also used by the PLAAF.
