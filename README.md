This is an implementation of the flight part of JD Webster's "Air Power" rules, published in the game "The Speed of Heat".

It is intended to run in a Google Colab notebook in a web browser (or other Python Notebook) and frees the players from much of the mechanical work associated with flight, allowing them to concentrate on the tactics and combat.
