Station 2 can alternatively carry a Mark 4 (weight 11,000), Mark 5 (weight 3,000), or Mark 6 (weight 8,000) nuclear bomb. All conventional bombs must be the same type and low-drag.",
    "Stations 1 and 4 may each carry a 700 gal (2600L) FT (weight 4,500, load 10.0/6.0, and 230 fuel points).",
    "As an exception to the normal rules, internal loads contribute 1 load point for each 1,000 of weight and internal fuel contributes 1 load point for each 50 fuel points. A return mission will typically require leaving the target with at least 1250 fuel points (25 load points).",
    "MTO Weight Limit. The maximum internal fuel load is reduced by 50 fuel points for every 1000 of weight of stores beyond 10,000. If the maximum weight of 28,000 is carried, the maximum internal fuel load is 3,640."
